        <p>Club Day</p>
        <p>Today I got up very early to go to the robotics club at my school, the club started at 8 a.m. and ended at 10 a.m. At the club I talked with my friends and built a car with an infrared sensor. After that I went to 3D Design and we installed a new program called Fusion, I was in 3D Design from 10 to 12 am. Then I ate in the cafeteria of the school a little meat with ham and cheese and a cookie, I also bought a water. At 1 o'clock I went to the finance club and finished at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. Leaving the school I bought a Subway that was very tasty, a cookie and some marinated Sabritas. At the end I went back home and started to do my homework.</p>
